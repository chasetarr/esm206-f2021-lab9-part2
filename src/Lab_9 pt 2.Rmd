```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(broom)

```

## Read in data
```{r}
lizards <- read_csv(here("data", "lizards.csv"))
```

Get counts of lizard species:
```{r}
lizards %>% 
  count(spp) %>% # counting species number
  arrange(-n) arrange based on largest species
```

## Make a subset
 - UTST lizards
 - Sites: IBPE (enclosure grassland site), RABB (rabbit mesquite site), "EAST" (east tarbush site)
 - only want to keep observations where tail condition is recorded (W = whole, B = broken)

```{r}
utst <- lizards %>% 
  filter(spp == "UTST") %>% 
  filter(site %in% c("IBPE", "RABB", "EAST")) %>% 
  filter(tail %in% c("W", "B"))
```
